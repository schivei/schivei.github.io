# About
I started my career in this industry after a friend incentivized me to start programming. That happened when I was a teacher at a small computer hardware school.

As a tech lead, I was responsible for managing people of different age groups, which was a nice experience because it allowed me to develop my skills in identifying the roles that would be more suitable for the team members. There was this situation in which I allocated a person who was resistant to SCRUM in the R&D team and kept the framework to the ones more open to the methodology. I was able to keep a functional work approach this way.

I positively impacted the company by allocating the correct human resources in their teams, where they could be more productive and profitable for the company by allowing them to discover approaches, processes and technologies that could boost the products developed by the company and provide more value to the customers.
